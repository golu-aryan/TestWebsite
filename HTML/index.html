    <p>A <strong>gym</strong>, short for gymnasium (pl.: <Strong>gymnasiums or gymnasia</Strong>), is an indoor venue
        for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise">exercise</a> and sports. The word is
        derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasion".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and
        as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also the commonly used name for a "fitness
        centre" or health club, which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or describe adjacent
        open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for
        basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical development
        training, or to do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can
        describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university, with or without the
        presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.</p>

    <p>In Gymnasiums, apparatus such as barbells, bumper plates, kettlebells, dumbbells, resistance bands, jumping
        boards, running paths, tennis balls, cricket fields, and fencing areas are used for exercises. Outdoor settings
        are healthiest when the weather is safe.[2] Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included
        self-defense, gymnastics medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and for physical fitness and
        sports, from boxing to dancing to skipping rope.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym#cite_note-3">[3]</a> </p>
